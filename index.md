## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="avatar.jpg">

I am a Postdoc researcher in the Department of Computer Science, at the University of Sheffield. I work with [Prof. Nikos Aletras](https://github.com/bk2dcradle/researcher) on developing explainable NLP models. Before my postdoc, I worked as a research assistant in the same department on building a retrieval system for public health research, funded by National Institute for Health Research. My PhD research applied transfer learning to hate speech detection tasks and investigated model bias.
