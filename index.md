## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="avatar.jpg">

I am a Postdoc researcher in [Natural Language Processing](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/natural-language-processing) at the Computer Science Department of the University of Sheffield. I work with [Prof. Nikos Aletras](https://github.com/bk2dcradle/researcher) on developing explainable NLP models. Before my postdoc, I worked as a research assistant in the same department on building a retrieval system for public health research, funded by National Institute for Health Research.
My PhD research applied transfer learning to hate speech detection tasks and investigated model bias, which was fully funded.

## Research Interest

'Model explanation'   'model bias'   'rationale faithfulness'   'misinformation detection'

## Research Experience


#### Postdoc Researcher

Department of Computer Science, The University of Sheffield

Explanable NLP

01/2022~02/2024

This research is part of a large interdisciplinary project, “Social Explainable Artificial Intelligence”, funded
by the EPSRC. The overall goal of this project is to explore a wide range of research directions on modelling disinformation diffusion, with a focus on developing explainable ML models. I work independently and with supervision on programming and compiling papers.



#### Research Assistant 
07/2022~08/2022

English and American Studies Team, The University of Manchester

Nineteenth-Century Nature Writing in English and Twenty-First-Century Environmentalism

This pilot project aims to open out research questions for a larger project on women’s nature writing in the long nineteenth century. My duty focuses on pre-processing related text and exploratory research on the related corpus, such as temporal shift and geographic drift.



#### Research Assistant 
07/2021~12/2021

Department of Computer Science, The University of Sheffield

Automatically mapping and assessing inequalities in public health research

This is a multidiscipline project, collaborated with UCL and King's College, funded by National Institute for Health Research. This project aims to develop automated methods to find, organize and describe scientific literature relevant to public health and understand its findings in relation to inequalities in health. Particularly, NLP techniques will be used to automatically organize these documents into topics, identify the research method used and identify whether it contains information about factors related to health inequalities at scale. My role was for programming and analysis.



#### Research Assistant 
11/2020~03/2021

Department of Computer Science, The University of Sheffield

Text Processing for Health Technology Assessment

The TePHTA is a cross-discipline study with researchers from the Computer Science Department and the School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield. This project aims to improve healthcare decision-making through natural language processing. I participate in a part of this project, the medical system review analysis, which utilizes machine learning to assist experts in healthy to gain insights from a massive volume of medical literature regarding employees' health situations and working conditions. I was in charge of programming and analysis.
